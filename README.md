## Legacy Python 3.7 support

This version requires Python >= 3.12. The final Python 3.7-compatible state
of this repository is preserved on the `py37-legacy` branch (and the
`py37-final` tag):

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/wingillis/moseq2-viz.git@py37-legacy"
```

The legacy branch is frozen (no new features); the modern branch is the
supported going forward.
